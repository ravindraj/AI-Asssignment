# AI-asssignment

This assignment gives the basic neural network implementaion of digit recognizer using MNIST Dataset.

We trained our model with all kinds ofoptimizers available in Keras such as SGD(using momentum), Adagrad, Adamax, Adam, Adadelta, RMSprop,Nadam.

Out of all of them Adam is giving the best accuracy for this dataset.

So we plotted the history of Adam optimizers and analyze the converging relationship with number of epochs.

So 10 epochs were found to be enough for this model.
